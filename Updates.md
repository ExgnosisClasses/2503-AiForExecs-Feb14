# Updates February 21

I will be updating this file regularly to keep the class informed of upcoming events and plans for the course.

#### Office Hour

Beginning the week of March 10, there will be eight one hour optional Q&A session with the instructor. The actual date and time of this hour will be decided on by the class. More on this in the Feb 21 class. The office hours were supposed to start the week of Feb 21 but have been pushed back several weeks due to the students' workload until March 7.

Demos of AI or machine learning can be requested in advance for the office hours, and any source code and data used will be added to the class repository

#### Hands on Lab

The first lab session is scheduled for March 7. I will be polling students over the next two weeks as to what sort of lab they would find most useful. I have to submit a set-up request for the hosted lab environments which needs your input.

One possibility for the lab session is for me to do a programming demo with the option to code along with me.

#### Homework

Beginning this week, there will be thought problems assigned to help you start to put what we will be talking about into a practical and real world context.

The homework should not take up a lot of your time since it will serve as a basis for class discussion. There will be no submission required although it is helpful if you can jot down some of your thoughts in point form to help me get an impression of your thinking.

Since the homework will provide the basis for a class brainstorming, I will be using these discussions as an input to your evaluations. This doesn't mean you should stress out about them.
